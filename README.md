# CyberSecurity-Internship-Portfolio
Portfolio of my internship at Cyber Defence Intelligence, showcasing skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity tools like Nikto, Burp Suite, Wireshark, and Hydra. Includes a CLI VirusTotal scanner project and simulations of ARP poisoning, SQL injection, and more.

## Introduction

I recently completed an internship at **Cyber Defence Intelligence (CDI) Consulting**, where I pursued and achieved the **Certified Ethical Hacker Expert (CEHE) certification**. This internship provided me with practical experience in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and advanced cybersecurity techniques, allowing me to develop a robust understanding of security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.

Throughout my internship, I focused on:

- **Web Application Security:** Performing detailed security assessments on web applications to identify and address potential threats.
- **Network Security:** Evaluating and securing network infrastructures against various cyber threats and attacks.
- **Tool Development and Utilization:** Creating and using custom tools to streamline and enhance security testing processes.

I gained hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as **Nikto, Burp Suite, Wireshark,** and **Hydra**, and executed various attack techniques including **SQL injection, ARP poisoning, brute force attacks, DDoS attacks,** and **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**. These experiences have enriched my technical skills and deepened my understanding of both offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices.

Additionally, I developed a **command-line interface (CLI) project** that integrates with the VirusTotal API for real-time scanning of files and URLs, demonstrating my capability to apply programming skills in a practical cybersecurity context.

My CEHE certification and internship experience have equipped me with comprehensive knowledge in ethical hacking methodologies, risk management, and the latest trends in cybersecurity. I am now focused on leveraging this expertise to contribute effectively to the cybersecurity field and tackle complex security challenges.
